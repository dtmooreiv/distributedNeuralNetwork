This project uses code from Michael Nielsen's Neural Networks and Deep Learning repository https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning

It currently handles provisioning a GPU instance on AWS and installing the project's dependencies. We plan on changing the project to support a multi-node training system.
